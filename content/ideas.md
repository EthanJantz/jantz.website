I'm planning out a reinforcement learning project based on my Minesweeper game.

A friend was comparing western expansion with exploring the internet and the idea has set a seed in my mind. Where are there similarities? Differences? Is it an apt metaphor? I'm not sure, but it's an interesting idea for some research.
