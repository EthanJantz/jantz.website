## barely-researched semi-rant on gov't PR

For as long as I've been cognizant of the public opinion on government I've understood it to view government as being wasteful and inefficient. I'm not here to debate whether that's the case ((according to the government it is)[https://www.gao.gov/high-risk-list]) and I'm not particularly interested in diving into the nuances of where that waste and inefficiency exists or how it came to be. Waste and inefficiency is a problem, it is also a problem that waste and inefficiency is portrayed as a major problem across the entirety of government, and that that portrayal is then used to justify the wholesale dismantling of programs that serve the public good. 

The political will to do this has been built over decades, and the government itself has done very little to convince the public otherwise despite the fact that it has the opportunity to do so wherever it provides public subsidies or benefits. For every mile of road, every mortgage it insures, every health center or early childhood care program it funds, every service or good it delivers, the government would be doing itself a favor to make it clear that thing is made possible because of the government. It should be running its own PR campaign in tandem with its services. Why aren't there more plaques and signs in the world noting that "X thing has been made possible by the local/state/federal government"? I'm not so naive as to understand that this is type of activity would be tricky to do and politically fraught, but I don't think it makes sense to do nothing.

To its credit, the government does a decent job at this on the internet. Though given the drastic changes going on right now I'm not sure how long that will be the case...
