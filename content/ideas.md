I'm back on it with these [abundists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_(Klein_and_Thompson_book)), and after reading the book I find them unconvincing. A lot of these ideas have been floating around for over a decade and _this_ is when they're pushing for them? As someone who came up in housing advocacy in the mid 2010's I'm not convinced that the technocrats see the forest for the trees -- or maybe the city for the two-flats? I don't disagree with most of what they advocate for, but I'm unimpressed by their vision. "We need to keep growing and making more things" and "technological progress is the answer" is only compelling if it can also acknowledge and address the consequences of production. If Klein starts talking about how we address the problems of industry like [East Palestine, OH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Palestine,_Ohio#2023_train_derailment), [lithium mining impacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impacts_of_lithium-ion_batteries), or [Michigan's toxic foam problem](https://www.michigan.gov/pfasresponse/faq/categories/pfas-foam-on-lakes-and-streams) with his vision then I'll be more convinced. These are policy wonks and they should be more thorough. 

I'm planning out a reinforcement learning project based on my Minesweeper game.

A friend was comparing western expansion with exploring the internet and the idea has set a seed in my mind. Where are there similarities? Differences? Is it an apt metaphor? I'm not sure, but it's an interesting idea for some research.
