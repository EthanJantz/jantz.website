I've been digging into vacant properties lately. There are properties like [Hotel Guyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyon_Hotel) that have sat vacant for decades, if not over a century. Currently there is a lot of discourse around building more housing, but I think there should be some attention paid to what we can do with the existing building stock to create that housing as well. There's plenty of [research](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/building-more-homes-isnt-enough-solve-housing-crisis) pointing to the importance of repurposing vacant properties. What kind of information might be useful to aid local governments (especially in Chicago) to redevelop those vacant buildings?
