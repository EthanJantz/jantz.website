Welcome to my website! I use this space to flesh out ideas I'm working on, share my side projects, and talk about things that excite me. My inspiration for putting this site together came from some conversations I had been having around the idea of a [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). I've been a blog reader for over a decade, and had always thought that a blog is a space for finished thoughts. This website is my attempt to challenge that assumption.

## About Me

I'm Ethan Jantz, a data scientist based out of Chicago, Illinois. I'm currently serving as a fellow in the [United States Digital Corps](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/). 

Before USDC I was a research analyst at the [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning](https://cmap.illinois.gov/), where I supported data-driven transportation planning and led the cloud migration for their open data portal. Prior to that I was in the inaugural cohort for the University of Illinois' [Master of Science in Civic Analytics program](https://cuppa.uic.edu/academics/pa/pa-programs/master-of-science-in-civic-analytics/) where I researched [state capacity](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4487654), [housing](https://voorheescenter.uic.edu/news-stories/who-can-live-in-chicago-investigating-housing-affordability-trends-using-2020-census-data/), and [accessibility](https://github.com/ada-parc).

Outside of work I listen to and play music, practice Wing Chun, bike, write, read, game, and think.

I welcome you to reach out to me via [email](mailto:ethan@jantz.website), I would love to hear from you!
