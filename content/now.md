## Learning {#learning}

Wrapped up [textbook](https://pragprog.com/titles/jwpython/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python-volume-1/) on data structures and algorithms.

I've been taking the dive into [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) lately. It's slow to start but super fun when the muscle memory kicks in for some actions!

I spent June starting to learn Muay Thai. It's challenging, and a nice complement to my growing martial arts practice. 

Getting into the weeds with [neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0).

Preparing for my time at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) by doing some toy Python and Bash projects. 

Jumping rope! Getting the rhythm takes some practice, it feels like learning to play drums for the first time again.

## Making {#making}

I printed and assembled some fun, useful things for myself and friends. Throwing together a tripod for my buddy's DSLR was particularly interesting. I would recommend against buying machine screws from Home Depot, they're pricier than just buying a box of assorted screws. 

Getting [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) to look and work the way I want it to. It's been a great learning experience. 

Working on a project focused on vacant properties in Chicago in response to some thoughts I've been having about the Abundists and their agenda. 

Solving problems on [SadServers](https://sadservers.com/).

## Enjoying {#enjoying}

Spending time with friends this summer before I head out of town.

Minneapolis, such a beautiful city! 

[New York City!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6014HuxcE)

[The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel))

A second time around with [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2)

[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Obscur:_Expedition_33)

[A Door Left Open - Orthodox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAMISEC6FkQ) - This album is what I was hoping it would be. Big rec to the metal enjoyers out there. 

[NEVER ENOUGH - Turnstile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfrnipyNcu0) - Another solid release. I'm digging how dynamic this album is. 

[dgenr8's new website](https://www.dgenr8.world/) is sick. I'm loving what Grady has been building this project into. If you haven't watched what he's [been posting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAV_0qpeMTA) you're missing out!
