## Learning {#learning}

[Proxmox VE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxmox_Virtual_Environment) -- first project node is running a hefty model fit. Super nice to not have it taking up resources from my daily driver

[A contextual analysis of Wagner's *The Nieblung's Ring*](https://www.ecosophia.net/the-nibelungs-ring-prelude/) -- well written essay series and the author has some interesting takes

[American history circa the western expansion via Empire Pod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4J4fA-OSNk) 

[Still on The Nature of Code, this is one of those slow burn projects.](https://natureofcode.com/)

[Perennially -- sticking hands and the wooden dummy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Chun)

## Making {#making}

Getting my homelab working

Spring has sprung, so I'm back on my pasta salad kick

I've got some writing spinning around on the topic of practice

[Minesweeper!](https://www.github.com/ethanjantz/py-sweeper) Got a grid system figured out and am planning on a bigger project. More to come

## Enjoying {#enjoying}

[Red Team Blues - Cory Doctorow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784417-red-team-blues) -- techy pulp fiction

Got to see [Yasuaki Shimizu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_TmLrovBQc) live this week. I've never seen floor seating at Thalia Hall before.  

[Manning Fireworks - MJ Lenderman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeGujHpGUIs) -- alt country with some good humor and heartbreaking vignettes

[Sinister Grift - Panda Bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0uc3Ag2yXM) -- like Heavy Metal, this one continues to grow on me

[Heavy Metal - Cameron Winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xee_2r-5L2U) -- still in rotation

The english fan translation of [Mother 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3)
